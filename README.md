## What does it do?
This program is a simple implementation of a change-making algorithm. It prompts the user to enter the amount of money owed and the amount paid. It then calculates the change to be given, in terms of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## What I learned
- Algorithmic thinking: This program requires breaking down a problem into smaller steps and designing a logical sequence of operations to solve it. It involves understanding how to perform calculations and manipulate data to achieve the desired outcome.
- Mathematical operations: The program utilizes mathematical operations such as division and modulo to calculate the number of each denomination of coins. This helps programmers enhance their mathematical skills and apply them in practical scenarios.
- Input validation: The program includes input validation to ensure that the user enters valid and appropriate values. This teaches programmers how to handle user input and implement error handling to provide a better user experience.
-Problem-solving skills: Creating this program involves solving a real-world problem (calculating change) using programming. It requires analyzing the problem, identifying the key steps, and implementing a solution. This helps programmers develop their problem-solving skills, which are crucial in software development.
-Code organization: The program demonstrates how to structure code by using functions to separate different parts of the logic. This promotes code reusability and maintainability, making it easier to read and understand the program.
